The Emperor's New Clothes - TreeSheetsL
=================================================


This is for the project [treesheets]（ https://github.com/aardappel/treesheets ）》The QT framework is used to reconstruct and sort out the source code. There is no meaning of infringement and offense. At the same time, I still appreciate the excellent ideological connotation and product concept of the original project.


This project inherits the original copyright and is published under ZLIB license (see ZLIB_LICENSE.txt)


If it's not necessary, this project will not be updated. It's a flash in the pan just for learning. If you want to know more about the latest developments, please go to https://github.com/aardappel/treesheets 。 This is just a record learning process. From the submission record, we can see that the code is extracted and translated from the original project bit by bit. Of course, the inevitable environmental differentiation is different from the purpose of this project, and some trade-offs are inevitable, such as giving up performance considerations, modifying / deleting some functions, etc.


The `app` directory of this project is a copy of the `TS` directory of the original project, and some of the description documents in it are irrelevant to this project. This project does not provide any description related documents except this`README`, and `src` is the actual source code project directory.


Building:
---------


I don't have any suggestions for this, just the normal QT project import process. Of course, I hope your QT compilation version is not too old (the compiler supports at least the C++11 standard).


No additional third-party libraries are added to the project, only three QT non default modules are added:


- network: process singleton model, inter program communication

- xml: XML import function

- printsupport: print and preview functions




Note
-----------


This project has not gone through an effective testing process, and even some functions have not been used since they were implemented. If you want to customize your distribution version based on this project, please carefully use the final product for formal occasions (unless you have been strictly tested). You will be responsible for the losses caused by program problems.


Of course, based on this project, if you have enough fun ideas, I hope you can share them with me.
